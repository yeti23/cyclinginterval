# Purpose of the app
The main purpose of the CyclingInterval app is to plan interval workouts on your Apple Watch. CyclingInterval supports both indoor and outdoor training. For indoor training, only wheel-on Trainers are compatible.

# Prerequisites
An iPhone running iOS 17.1 or higher, an Apple Watch with WatchOS 10 or higher, a power sensor, a Turbo Trainer and a speedometer for indoor workouts.

# Why use CyclingInterval?
Exercises are planned directly on your Apple Watch, and are reusable. Workouts can be exported in FIT, TCX and GPX formats.
